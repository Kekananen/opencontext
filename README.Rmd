## opencontext: An R API client for the Open Context archeological database

This packages enables browsing and downloading data from [Open Context](http://opencontext.org/) using R. Open Context reviews, edits, and publishes archaeological research data and archives data with university-backed repositories, including the California Digital Library.

## Installation

Install `opencontext`

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/opencontext")
```

```{r}
library("opencontext")
```

## Browse countries 

To browse the countries that Open Context has data on:

```{r}
countries <- oc_browse("countries")
```

The result is a data table that include the names of the countries in `countries$labels`, and URLs that we can use to get more information about what projects, etc. are avialable for each country in `countries$id`

## Browse locations

To browse the locations for one country:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
locations <- oc_browse(type = "countries") %>%
   filter(label == "Turkey") %>%
   oc_get_countries(type = "location")

```

To browse the locations that have archaeological data in Turkey, run `locations$label`

## Browse projects

To inspect the projects available for a location in a country, for example Ulucak:

```{r}
oc_get_locations("Turkey", "Ulucak")

```
